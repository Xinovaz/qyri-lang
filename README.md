# What is this?
Qyli, after "qili," the Albanian word for "candle," is an in-depth and intelligent programming language, that boasts a clean syntax and a limitless ecosystem. Qyli reinforces good programming habits while still being intuitive and friendly.

# Why Qyli?
Qyli offers an endless number of opportunities. Qyli is elegant and pure, meaning the highlight of your code is its beauty. Any error messages you recieve come packed with information, meaning you won't have to track down those pesky commas. Qyli's syntax is very clean. Simplicity is key when designing your projects, and Qyli unlocks that for you, which means saying goodbye to spaghetti code. Qyli's naming conventions are designed to allow anyone reading your code to be able effectively understand it.

But that's not all. Qyli offers not only beauty in its code, but in its runtime as well. Qyli is fast and not at all performance-heavy. Upon compilation, Qyli minimises any code, only allocating what is needed, and is excellent at lightweight halting.

# Why not Qyli?
Don't use Qyli if you aren't focused on lightweight shipping. Typed constants and numeric emulation are possible, but not suggested for a conventional Qyli program. There aren't many reasons not to use Qyli, but those that are are based solely on purism and preference.

# Ok. I'm convinced. Where do I start?
