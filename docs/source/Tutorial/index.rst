Qyri offers a lot. And "a lot" is sometimes too much. Sometimes, "too much" can bog you down. I don't want you too get bogged down. I could beg you not to bog down, I could drop to my knees and plead, but I won't. Instead, I'll just give you this. A tutorial. That way, a lot, is really a bunch of littles. And a little won't bog you down.
