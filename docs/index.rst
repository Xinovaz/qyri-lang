The Qyri Programming Language
----
Qyri is a multi-paradigm, syntactically sweet language that boasts a clean syntax and a limitless ecosystem. Qyri offers an endless number of opportunities. Qyri is elegant and pure, meaning the higihlight of your code is its beauty. The basis of Qyri is the simple ideology that code should be readable and extendable.

What does Qyri do that's so special?
----
Qyri runs in its own virtual machine, with a seperate language frontend and backend. This means that Qyri's VM is integratable anywhere. However, the true centerpiece of Qyri is the readability of your code. Qyri is dynamically-typed, meaning you can focus on objectivity without the need for computer antics. However, in the event that your code needs explicit typing, Qyri supports statically-typed programming as well. Qyri also follows imperative programming as well as functional programming, and shares pretty functional syntax with Haskell and similar languages. One example of such syntax is infix operators, as well as some pipeline operation as well.
